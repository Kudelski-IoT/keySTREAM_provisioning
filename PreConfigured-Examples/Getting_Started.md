# Trust MANAGER and keySTREAM SaaS

This guide provides a clear step-by-step process for onboarding an ECC608 TrustMANAGER with the KeySTREAM SaaS from Kudelski IoT, implementing an cloud usecase using AWS. It's important to note that manual secure exchange processes are not required during manufacturing with this onboarding methodology. The customized root CA and  associated PKI is preconfigured in keySTREAM, and the device certificate is provisioned after the device is deployed to the field.

### During the evaluation of the ECC608 TrustMANAGER and keySTREAM from Kudelski IOT, you will be guided through the following steps:
 - Create keySTREAM account
 - Create your root CA within keySTREAM and its associated PKI
 - Operate certificate management operations remotely from keySTREAM
 - How to run the script and generate the pre-configured Package for the TrustMANAGER
 - Video tutorial on Youtube - available soon !!!

## Pre-Use Case Transaction Steps

### keySTREAM Account Setup and Requirements

- Step 1: Creating Kudelski keyStream account
  - Now that we have an AWS account, you have to create an account on Kudelski keySTREAM portal to proceed with the use case. Registration is free.
    - **1.1:** Go to the following link for account creation. [Register link](https://mc.obp.iot.kudelski.com) 
    - **1.2** Click on register.

    - **1.4** Look out for the verification code on the registered email. Enter the verification code once it is available to you. Once the right code is entered you should see the successful account creation message.
        <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/kudelski_keystream_verify.png" style="width: 65%; display: block"><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 65%;">Figure 3</figcaption></figure>
- Step 2: Creating [fleet profile](#creating-a-fleet-profile) under Keystream portal.
  - In this step we will create a fleet profile under the Kudelski keystream portal. Fleet profile could represent a product line or a subdivision under a product line. For example, you can setup a fleet profile for a line of internet connected thermostat, this will let you remotely manage those specific devices. During the creation of Fleet profile, we will provide information required for creating Root CA that will be used for these specific set of devices. All the devices under the fleet profile will be signed by this Root CA certificate. Each created fleet profile will always have a Root CA certificate associated with it.
    - **2.1** Login to the Kudelski keystream portal.
         <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/kudelski_keystream_portal_2.png" style="width: 65%; display: block;" /><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 65%;">Figure 4</figcaption></figure>
    - **2.2** Upon completing the registration process, you will gain access to your own tenant on the keySTREAM SaaS platform from Kudelski IoT.

<figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/kiot_home_page.png" style="width: 65%; display: block;" /><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 65%;">Figure 5</figcaption></figure>

For the upcoming steps, it's essential to be signed in to the keySTREAM portal.

### Creating a Fleet Profile

A Fleet profile
  - Is a label attached to a fleet of devices sharing the same configuration.<br>
  - Serves as a link between you, the device manufacturer, and the device you will have in the field.<br>
  - Will be referenced both on keySTREAM and in your device firmware.<br>
  - Is identified by a **Fleet Profile Public UID** that is easily readable by a human, as further explained below.<br>

The keySTREAM portal allows creation a Fleet Profile and attach a configuration to it:

- Click on **Fleet & PKI** from left panel as shown in below figure.<br>
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/fleet_mgmt.png" style="width: 75%; display: block;" /><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 75%;">Figure 6</figcaption></figure>

- Click on **FLEET & CERT** and **CREATE**  as shown in figure below.
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/create_profile.png" style="width: 75%; display: block;" /><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 75%;">Figure 7</figcaption></figure>
- A popup window appears :
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/profile_details.png" style="width: 75%; display: block;" /><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 75%;">Figure 8</figcaption></figure>

  -  The following fields can be configured :
     - **Fleet Profile Public Uid (required) :** 
        A unique URI string, identifying the Fleet Profile. It is advised to avoid creating two Fleet Profiles with the same name. The final Fleet Profile Public Uid would be a concatenation of an auto-generated prefix (e.g. 9S4F:) and the Fleet Profile Public Uid (example.org:dp:network:device) that has been defined. The final Fleet Profile Public Uid would look like 9S4F:example.org:dp:network:device.
     - **Model, Brand and Manufacturer:** they are optional and purely informational, for your own use.

- Upon clicking on **NEXT**, you can create your own Root Certificate Authority (CA) associated with this new Fleet Profile:
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/ca_configure.png" style="width: 75%; display: block;" /><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 75%;">Figure 9</figcaption></figure>
  
  - This is the step where you create your customized root Certificate Authority. The following fields will have to be configured:
     - **Root CA Common Name (CN):** This field is restricted to a fixed length of 16 Bytes. In case your input is shorter, it will be right-padded with spaces; a longer input will be truncated.

     - **Root CA Organization (O):** This field is restricted to a fixed length of 16 Bytes. In case your input is shorter, it will be right-padded with spaces; a longer input will be truncated. Notice that the Organization Unit will be hardcoded to TrustMANAGER.

     - **Root CA Certificate Validity(Years):** Number of Year(s) of validity of the Root CA.
   
     - **Device Operational Certificate validity (Years):** The number of Year(s) of validity of the Device Operational Certificate. It shall be shorter than the RooT CA Certificate validity.
   
  - After you click on **COMMIT**, a newly configured Fleet Profile with its freshly created custom Root CA appears in the list below: 
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/device_profile_list_tpds.png" style="width: 75%; display: block;" /><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 75%;">Figure 10</figcaption></figure>

  - All devices that are configured with this Fleet Profile will be provisioned with a unique device certificate signed by the certificate authority (CA) associated to this Fleet Profile when they register on keySTREAM.

  - **Creating a 2-Tier Fleet Profile**
  - If you need to create a 2-Tier Fleet Profile, follow the steps below:
  
    - Root CA of your 2-Tier PKI: You can have only one 2-Tier Root CA, which will sign as many 2-Tier Intermediate CAs as needed.
    - Click on **Fleet & PKI** from the left panel, then select **2-TIER ROOT CA**, and finally click on **OK** as shown in the figure below.
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/2tier_fleet.png" style="width: 75%; display: block;" ><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 75%;">Figure 11</figcaption></figure>
    - A popup window appears :
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/2tier_ca.png" style="width: 75%; display: block;"><figcaption
    style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 75%;">Figure 12</figcaption></figure>
   
    - After creating a ROOT CA, a pop-up will appear indicating that it has been successfully created, as shown in the figure below.
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/2tier_pop.png" style="width: 75%; display: block"><figcaption
    style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 75%;">Figure 13</figcaption></figure>

    - Click on **FLEET & CERT** and  **CREATE**, as shown in figure below.
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/2tier_create.png" style="width: 75%; display: block"><figcaption
    style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 75%;">Figure 14</figcaption></figure>
    - A popup window appears :

## Device claiming using the *Autoclaim* flow 

- The Autoclaim flow applies only if you create the keySTREAM account AND enter your email address used to login into microchipdirect.com BEFORE you place a purchase of ECC608 TrustMANAGER following this specific [this link](https://www.microchipdirect.com/trust-platform).
- There is no need to upload the manifest with the autoclaim flow. This step is completely automated between Microchip and keySTREAM.  
- This flow will NOT work if : 
  - You work with a development kit with an ECC608 TrustMANAGER soldered directly on the PCB like the EV10E69A or DT100104 â€“ use the **Claim by Manifest** flow instead.
  - You purchased your loose ECC608 TrustMANAGER from microchipdirect.com BEFORE opening your keySTREAM account and registering your microchipdirect.com email address.
- Make sure to follow those steps : 
  - Create an account on microchipdirect.com â€“ do not buy the ECC608 TrustMANAGER yet. 
  - Create a keySTREAM account 
  - Go the DEVICE OWNERSHIP in the left navigation menu 
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/device_Ownership.png" style="width: 65%; display: block;" /><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 65%;">Figure 18</figcaption></figure>
  - Choose AUTOCLAIMING 
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/auto_claim.png" style="width: 65%; display: block;" /><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 65%;">Figure 19</figcaption></figure>    
  - Click on the button CREATE
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/auto_claim_create.png" style="width: 65%; display: block;" /><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 65%;">Figure 20</figcaption></figure>
  - The following window pops up. The field MicrochipDirect Purchaser is where you enter the email address used to log into your microchipdirect.com account.
    <figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/auto_claim_form.png" style="width: 65%; display: block;" /><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 65%;">Figure 21</figcaption></figure>  
  - Choose ECC608-TMNGTLS in the Chip Part Number field and click COMMIT. Your device will show up in your DEVICE OWNERSHIP window as **Claimed**. They will turn to **Active** once the infield provisioning is successful.

## Running the Configuration Script and Generating Your Device Package

Follow these steps to generate a pre-configured package for your desired device:

- Run the configuration script (`Config.ps1`).
- Select the **TrustMANAGER** folder when prompted.
- Choose your desired device type: **D21**, **SAME54**, or **SG41** (these are pre-configured device options).
- Enter the required information when prompted (such as WiFi SSID, WiFi password, and Fleet Profile UID).
- The script will generate the package and display the path to the generated MPLAB X project file.
- Open the provided `.X` project file in **MPLAB X IDE** to continue with the rest of the process.
- For more details on project creation, refere Readme.md

<figure style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/Config_Script.png" style="width: 65%; display: block;" /><figcaption style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; clear: both; width: 65%;">Figure 22</figcaption></figure>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Note:** 

- Ensure that your project file is located in a short directory path. Long file paths may cause build and compilation failures.
- If you are using a D21 device, please ensure that the Fleet Profile is not linked to FOTA services.
- If you are using a SAME54 device, please ensure that your entire project path is located in short directory path (for ex. C:\). Otherwise you may encounter long path issues.
